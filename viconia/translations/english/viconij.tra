@206  = ~Are you getting soft, Viconia, letting a few stares affect you to such a degree?~
@207  = ~They ARE scared, Viconia.  That's why they hate you, because you incite fear in them.~
@208  = ~I have tried that, but it just makes them glare back twofold!  I only wish to pass in peace.  Why must they have such problems with me?!  Accusations are flung from every eye, and you pass without a glance.  Except for those who recognise your significance, and cower in fear!~
@209  = ~They are but iblith, filth!  They should not affect me, and yet, I look into their faces and I care--why is this, <CHARNAME>?!~
@210  = ~Maybe because, deep down inside, you really just want to be accepted for who you are.~
@211  = ~Yes, they are filth--but they are as sentient as you or I, and they hate you.  Nobody likes to be hated, Viconia, even you.~
@212  = ~You're deluding yourself, Viconia.  You don't care, you're drow--you don't have emotions, remember?~

@215  = ~Accepted for who I am?  Hah!  I do not need to be accepted, <CHARNAME>; so long as a woman knows where she stands--above the rest--then she does not need acceptance.  You would do well to remember that.~
@216  = ~You might have done well in drow society, if you were better versed in such things.  Alas, somehow, I doubt that will ever happen.  Praise the gods you were not born drow, kivvil.  You would not survive a moment.~

@234  = ~But unfortunately, there is more to it than that.  Much as I am loathe to admit it, you are my protection in this gods-forsaken place, so I must deal with your idiosyncracies and meaningless conversation in order to survive.~
@235  = ~Leave me, <CHARNAME>.  I've no mind to speak with you.~
@236  = ~What?  Why do you insist on staring at me, <CHARNAME>?  Frankly, your forced cheerfulness is setting my teeth on edge and I do not like it. Why do I interest you so?~ [I#BLANK]

@260  = ~I trust my instincts.  Don't you trust yours?~
@261  = ~Shut your mouth, Viconia.  Don't speak of what you know *nothing* about.~

@264  = ~Bah, I should know better than to ask that question.~
@265  = ~Perhaps.  Life with you is easier than hiding by day.  I can appreciate little things such as the lack of bloodthirsty mobs hungering for my blood.~
@266  = ~Exciting?  Is that what fuels you--excitement?~
@267  = ~Your compassion is misplaced, and you are a fool if you think it will help you live longer in my presence.  I am not your friend, nor does your so called 'friendship' interest me.  I travel with you because you are useful.  Nothing more.~
@268  = ~My instincts are sharper than yours, kivvil.  It is a product of my society, even as your dull senses are a product of yours.  What you think they tell you are mere shadows of the truth.  Or it could just be worms.  Believe what you will, <CHARNAME>, but do not think it makes you any safer.~

@272  = ~Out with it, kivvil, before I lose what little patience I have left.~
@273  = ~You interest me.  I'm always looking to learn more about others.~
@274  = ~I've never met a drow before--what do you expect me to do?~
@275  = ~I was just staring into space. You happened to be in the way.~

@286  = ~How did you come to worship Shar, Viconia?~
@287  = ~I didn't come here to listen to you whine, Viconia.~
@288  = ~My apologies.  I'll get going.~
@289  = ~Are you deaf, kivvil?  Blind?  If you wish to talk, surely it can wait until my Goddess is appeased?  (sigh) But now you are here and the moment has passed.  Speak quickly before I lose my patience.~
@290  = ~How did you come to worship Shar?~
@291  = ~Compared to the...extravagance of the rituals used to gain the favor of Lloth, this one shines with purity.~
@292  = ~Now if that was all you had to say I would appreciate some peace and quiet...~
@293  = ~...unless of course you wish me to demonstrate one of Lloth's rituals.  I would need a sacrifice, of course, but I'm sure you could fill in there.~
@294  = ~Then you may leave, kivvil.  Goodnight.~
@295  = ~What business is it of yours, mal'ai?~
@296  = ~It isn't, but I'm curious all the same.~
@297  = ~It's my business because I like to know what the members of my group are doing.~
@298  = ~It isn't my business.  My apologies.~
@299  = ~You can be as curious as you like, iblith, it won't change the fact I will not speak of Shar, unless...no.  Perhaps another time.  It would amuse me to hear your bumbling thoughts, but now is not appropriate.~
@300  = ~That sounds rather proprietary, <CHARNAME>; do you think of us as your playthings, perhaps?  Your toys?  Are we supposed to yip when you stroke our fur?~
@301  = ~I am not your property, and I will not speak of Shar, unless...no.  Perhaps another time.  It would amuse me to hear your bumbling thoughts, but now is not appropriate.~
@302  = ~I'm not one to give promises I may not keep, so we shall see.  In the meantime--I would conduct my prayer in peace.  Leave me be, waeles, I have much to do before I rest.  If something untoward should happen...well, I'm sure I'll hear you scream.~
@303  = ~I have arrived at a decision regarding whether or not to tell you about my dealings with Shar, kivvil.  But in return, as is the custom with Shar, you must give me something of equal or greater value.~ [I#BLANK]
@304  = ~What did you have in mind?~
@305  = ~I don't think I'm going to like this, am I?~
@306  = ~In all honesty, I don't particularly care about your dealings with Shar.~
@307  = ~What in the nine hells are you talking about, woman?~
@308  = ~You saved my life, so according to your quaint surfacer customs, I owe you a debt.~
@309  = ~You wish to know of how I turned to Shar?  I will tell you in exchange for the nullification of that debt.  I've no interest in having it hang over my head, and I am quite sure it is best to be rid of it.~
@310  = ~That sounds like a fair request.  Well then; tell me, and consider your debt paid.~
@311  = ~That's ridiculous!  A story, in exchange for a life-debt?  Who do you think I am?  Ilmater?~
@312  = ~If that is your wish, Viconia, consider it paid.  But you needn't tell me your story if you don't want to.~
@313  = ~That debt is of your own creation.  Would you consider it paid?~
@314  = ~Then I shall keep them to myself.~
@315  = ~The debt meant nothing, and I am glad to be rid of it.  I have proved myself in battle and otherwise, and no longer have need of that particular facade.~
@316  = ~You are a fool, kivvil; many would kill to have knowledge of the Clergy of Shar.~
@317  = ~Luckily for you, the debt means nothing to me, and I will tell my story regardless.  I have proved myself in battle and otherwise, and no longer have need of that particular facade.~
@318  = ~To be candid, auflaque, the debt means nothing to me.  I have proved myself in battle and otherwise, and no longer have need of that particular facade.~
@319  = ~Heed this story well, for I will not repeat it--however much you beg.~
@320  = ~For various reasons, I was forced to flee the Underdark, pursued by many who wished me dead.  There were lives lost, and my refuge became the hated surface.~
@321  = ~I could not travel by day at first, but soon began to adapt.  I was ostracised, stoned and attacked by any who discovered my identity, and I had nothing left to live for but a burning desire for revenge.~
@322  = ~I was approached by a veiled woman: she took one look at me--lost, angry and confused, and laughed.  I struck her across the face for her insolence, and was rewarded with unconsciousness.~
@323  = ~I awoke in a dark room, chained to a chair, naked.  I demanded an explanation, but there was no response from my captor, who simply sat and watched.  Watched as I slowly starved, as I struggled and screamed for release.~
@324  = ~The great Viconia, captured and put in chains by a mere surfacer woman!  How very amusing.~
@325  = ~What happened then?~
@326  = ~I don't want to hear the rest.~
@327  = ~I'm glad it entertains you, auflaque, since if you continue your mockery it will be the last thing you ever hear.~
@328  = ~How long I was there I do not know, but it didn't seem to matter.  After what seemed like days the woman looked me in the eye, and smiled.  "You are alone," she murmured; "Poor little drow, all alone in the big wide world, with nothing left to lose."~
@329  = ~She told me there was one interested in me, who shared my views.  Someone who could help.  At first I didn't understand what she meant, but what little Common I had learned in my brief interlude on the surface was enough to piece it together.~
@330  = ~She offered power, and I accepted it with relish.  It was as simple as that.~
@331  = ~That was a little...anticlimactic.  I was expecting something a little more grandiose.~
@332  = ~Simple?  You were captured and brainwashed.  That hardly sounds simple to me.~
@333  = ~I don't think I've ever heard of a clergy going to such ridiculous lengths to convert someone.~
@334  = ~That sounds horrible.  I'm so sorry, Viconia.~
@335  = ~But you will hear it.  I have not made this decision for naught.~
@336  = ~It may not be grandiose, but there it is.~
@337  = ~Brainwashed?  No.  I have wrung the truth from many a mind and substituted lies; all this woman did was show me the truth of my situation.~
@338  = ~All she did was show me the truth of my situation.~
@339  = ~Your compassion is insulting.  She showed me the truth of my situation, and I did nothing I did not will.~
@340  = ~Take it as you may, wael, I care not.  I do find it amusing, however, that...no matter.  Perhaps later.~
@341  = ~One day, kivvil, this disgusting trust of yours will get us all killed, and there will be no one to salvage the situation.  I simply cannot believe there is anything between your ears at all.~ [I#BLANK]
@342  = ~Slow down; what brought this on?~
@343  = ~Can I help you, Viconia?~
@344  = ~Shut your mouth!  I'll not hear another word of your whining, Viconia.  Leave, now, before I really get angry.~
@345  = ~I'll get us all killed?  Lower your hood in central Athkatla and we could all be killed.  Doesn't that put us in the same boat?~
@346  = ~Your insipid lack of distrust!~
@347  = ~I simply cannot believe your idiocy, this--this insipid lack of distrust!~
@348  = ~No!  You will listen to this, you idiotic <PRO_MANWOMAN>!~
@349  = ~No, it does not, because I have an inkling of good sense--I cannot say the same about you.~
@350  = ~You took every word I said as fact, accepting it as truth--how do you know I was not simply lying?  I am drow, we are known for our duplicity, if you will recall, and yet you believed my ridiculous tale to the last!~
@351  = ~The world is not a kindly place filled with rainbows and happiness, and if you do not keep your mind open to the possibility of betrayal you will die.~
@352  = ~I, at least, have no wish to be led to the slaughter.~
@353  = ~What are you trying to say, Viconia?~
@354  = ~It is not, no.  But I trust you, as I have said countless times before, and I trust you will not betray me.~
@355  = ~But if you are too wary, you will never learn of things such as friendship, trust and even love.~
@356  = ~Are you telling me that entire story was a fabrication?~
@357  = ~I am saying that I lied to you, and that you lapped it up like a cat drinking milk.~
@358  = ~Trust is death.  When will you realise this?  I may not betray you, but there are others who would.  Your lack of forethought disgusts me.~
@359  = ~In the Underdark, waela, these things do not exist.  They are surfacer creations, idiotic and dangerous; I will have no part in them, and if you value your life and secrets, neither should you.  That is life.~
@360  = ~But tell me, <CHARNAME>--morbid curiosity compels me.  Did you truly believe I would tell you what actually happened?~
@361  = ~Yes.  Can you blame me for wanting to believe?~
@362  = ~I believe you will be there if I have need of you, regardless of your lies.  And that is what matters.~
@363  = ~Perhaps.  But what does it matter to you?  Obviously you don't care at all.~
@364  = ~Lie to me again, Viconia, and I will kill you where you stand.  Is that understood?~
@365  = ~Of course not, but your story amused me nonetheless.  I am no fool.~
@366  = ~I can, yes.  If you believed for a moment I would spill such important information then perhaps you should end your blissfully ignorant existance.  I believe there is a river not far from here--do yourself a favor and dive deep into its depths.  Do not return.~
@367  = ~Your belief leaves you defenceless and vulnerable, much like a newborn babe.  Perhaps you should do us all a favor and end your blissfully ignorant existance, <CHARNAME>.  It would be far easier, for yourself if not everyone else.~
@368  = ~What a wonder, the beast *does* have some semblance of intelligence!  No, I do not care in the least, wise one.  ~
@369  = ~Your threats are empty, and carry no merit.  I will do as I wish--as you are free to do as you wish.  I offer you the chance to make your own decisions, your own choices, something your so-called "friends" do not.~
@370  = ~I am glad you have some semblance of intelligence, wael.  I had thought all hope lost.~
@371  = ~Curiosity about your future encourages my continued allegiance, but who is to say that will continue?  Far better to distrust and survive than trust and die, hmm?~
@372  = ~Everyone has secrets, wael; mine are more precious than most.  Shar does not look kindly upon the sharing of her mysteries, and neither do I.  I suggest you do not expect the impossible, or you will be sorely disappointed.~
@373  = ~The road ahead is filled with possibility.  Seize the opportunities which arise, but be cautious.~
@374  = ~Death comes in many forms--the very least of which is a sword.~
@375  = ~So this is hell.  Somehow I expected something a little more thrilling, I must admit.  It all seems a little pedestrian, don't you think?  I always imagined there would be a more dark look to the place, but it seems rather cheery.  How very disappointing.~ [I#BLANK]
@376  = ~I...wish to apologise for my late reticence towards you.  It is not fitting after what you have done for me.~ [I#BLANK]

@382  = ~I do not tell you for your gratitude, wael.  I want to make that quite clear before we face death.~

@385  = ~I'm not completely brainless.  But thank you nonetheless.~
@386  = ~Excuses, excuses.  Admit it.  You like me.~

@430  = ~That was a handmaiden of Lolth, and a yochlol.  Gated assassins.  To think that she would go to such efforts to gather me up, it is almost beyond belief.  Why would she come after me now, after all this time?  Why now?  Has she grown bored with my escapades, or is there some other reason?  And...what will she do to take me, next?!~
@431  = ~If she sends more, I'll deal with them the same as I did these ones.  Do not worry.~
@432  = ~Calm yourself, Viconia!~
@433  = ~What do you intend to do?~
@434  = ~How do you think I feel?!  If she sends more of those things, all of us are in danger, not just you!~
@435  = ~Do not fawn over me, fool!  I suffered a psychic attack, that is all!  There is little that magic can do to assist me at the moment!~
@436  = ~Far easier said than done, <CHARNAME>!  Even you are no match for Lolth--she would kill you before you had time to speak a word!  Xsa ol!  Leave me be!~
@437  = ~I am calm!  Even you are no match for Lolth--she would kill you before you had time to speak a word!  Xsa ol!  Leave me be!~
@438  = ~Do?  I--I do not know--but you are no match for Lolth!  We would be slaughtered as lambs--she would kill you before you had time to speak a word!  Xsa ol!  Leave me be!~
@439  = ~And what would you have me do, <CHARNAME>?  Leave?  Return to the Underdark and plead for mercy?  There is no mercy for me!  There is no mercy!!~
@440  = ~You don't deserve mercy, Viconia.  You're a dark-hearted bitch who cares about nothing but herself.~
@441  = ~Yes, leave...find some way to save yourself, but I won't have you endangering me or the others!~
@442  = ~No.  Stay here...it is the safest place for you.  We will find a way around this--she can't keep hunting you forever.~
@443  = ~I feel so helpless...(sigh)~
@444  = ~Pleading for mercy will do you no good.  We're just going to have to be watchful...there's nothing else we can do, Viconia.~
@445  = ~Is that what you think?!  Iblith jaluk!  Darkness take you, <CHARNAME>, skiki cos lu'el!~
@446  = ~You cast me out?!  I should have known it would come to this!  All trust is foolish!  Darkness take you, <CHARNAME>, skiki cos lu'el!~
@447  = ~But she can!  Even you are no match for Lolth--she would kill you before you had time to speak a word!  Xsa ol!  Leave me be!~
@448  = ~*You* feel helpless?!  You are not the one being hunted by a vengeful goddess!  Iblith kivvil, even you are no match for Lolth--she would kill you before you had time to speak a word!  Xsa ol!  Leave me be!~
@449  = ~That is not enough!  Iblith kivvil, even you are no match for Lolth--she would kill you before you had time to speak a word!  Xsa ol!  Leave me be!~
@450  = ~You surfacers have such quaint views on marriage!  In the Underdark, such an exchange would have meant death for the husband, as well as his mistress.  Matters are far less messy.~
@451  = ~I'm sure they are--but I doubt any drow knows love.~
@452  = ~How very...appropriate.  I've always loathed adultery.~
@453  = ~It might be less messy, but it can't be right.~
@454  = ~Sounds just about perfect to me.~
@455  = ~That hardly sounds fair!~
@456  = ~I'm sure there are those that do--but I imagine they are ostracized or forced to keep it strictly secret.~
@457  = ~Is that what you call it?  I myself find it rather amusing.  Females among the drow do what they wish--males try, of course, but most are worms who hardly deserve such freedom, and remain in the dirt where they belong.~
@458  = ~And since when is drow culture subject to your standards of morality, hmm?  Consider, perhaps, that what you might think of as wrong another might think of as right.  Moral principles are not as universal as some suppose.~
@459  = ~From what I've experienced and observed, it works rather well, yes.~
@460  = ~I myself have had four husbands, and killed each as I lost interest.  Marriage in the Underdark is a transient union, usually born of gratification and indulgence.  The male's role is merely to service the female's needs and supply his seed or recreation--depending upon a woman's disposition.~
@461  = ~You're a despicable person, Viconia.  I hope you realize that.~
@462  = ~*Four* husbands?  How old are you, exactly, Viconia?~
@463  = ~Gratification and indulgence, you say?  Sounds interesting.~
@464  = ~What sort of illusions do you harbor about me, <CHARNAME>?  I am not some prancing fairy bestowing wondrous gifts on the good children of Faerun.~
@465  = ~Old enough to know the folly of such unions.  There are plenty of other ways to receive gratification that hardly require a quarter the effort.  Of course, my perspective has evolved slightly since the time I married my first male.~
@466  = ~Of course, there are plenty of other ways to receive gratification that hardly require a quarter the effort.  But my perspective has evolved slightly since the time I married my first male.~
@467  = ~Monogamy is so very mundane, don't you agree?  To commit to one person, and one only...it is all very boring.~
@468  = ~To love and be loved by one person is the most amazing experience one can have.~
@469  = ~You have no idea what you're talking about, drow.  Shut your mouth.~
@470  = ~I would have to agree, yes.  Far easier to pick and choose, don't you think?~
@471  = ~You'll have to ignore my complete and utter lack of faith in that statement, kivvil.  I'm afraid I've never had such an experience, but if I did, I'm sure the male would not live long.  Such weakness is pitiable and, frankly, dangerous.~
@472  = ~You'll have to ignore my complete and utter lack of faith in love, kivvil.  I'm afraid I've never had such an experience, but if I did, I'm sure the male would not live long.  Such weakness is pitiable and frankly, dangerous.~
@473  = ~I could hardly have phrased it better myself.~
@474  = ~I feel far more secure when the males I choose to bed are shackled and I am the one free to do as she pleases.~
@475  = ~So this is what the great House DeVir is reduced to--running and hiding in remote outposts, hoping for succor and receiving the pit in return.  How very appropriate, and long overdue.~ [I#BLANK]
@476  = ~Viconia, these people are your...family?~
@477  = ~Nobody deserves a fate like this.  Not even you.~
@478  = ~What have they done which was so monstrous that this is their deserved fate?~
@479  = ~All Drow deserve such an end.  Present company excepted, of course.~
@480  = ~Their helpless pleas are rather amusing, yes.~
@481  = ~If you could call them that.~
@482  = ~Not even your Irenicus, <CHARNAME>?~
@483  = ~There are always those who deserve such a fate, if not worse.  And for what they did to me, this is a light punishment.  They all deserve to fester and rot in the bowels of an Ankheg.~
@484  = ~These were the people who would have my heart ripped out and fed to the spiders.  Those who banished me for not wishing death upon a child, and those who killed thousands in their quest for power.  I care not for those deaths, however; I have...there is much which must be avenged.  This fate is trifling in comparison to that which I have wished upon them oft times past.~
@485  = ~It does my soul good to see them in such misery.  Perhaps I should stay and enjoy the view a little longer...but no.  These worms do not deserve my notice.  Let us leave these fools to their fate.~
@486  = ~Do you actually know any of these people?~
@487  = ~You scare me sometimes, Viconia.  Do you even know what the word "forgiveness" means?~
@488  = ~Yes, let's get going.  I've no wish to watch these people suffer.~
@489  = ~Perhaps we could offer their captors some incentive to make their deaths all the more painful?~
@490  = ~They deserve worse than this for what they did to you.~
@491  = ~It matters not.  They are of the same blood, and therefore deserve the same fate.~
@492  = ~How can you say that?  For all you know, these people could be innocent!~
@493  = ~True enough.  Then we will let them suffer in peace, shall we?~
@494  = ~Your ways will forever be alien to me, Viconia.~
@495  = ~Point.  Maybe we should help...repay their debts in more detail?~
@496  = ~"Forgiveness" is one of your weaknesses; an excuse for your inability to follow through.~
@497  = ~These people do not deserve your "forgiveness", nor your compassion.  They are beneath my notice and therefore beneath yours.~
@498  = ~Was that a veiled acknowledgement, Viconia?~
@499  = ~I don't think I'll ever understand you.~
@500  = ~How do you know these people were the ones who did those things to you?~
@501  = ~Then you have no appreciation for revenge.~
@502  = ~Let's not waste any more time on these filth.  They may deserve a more...intricate death, but no matter.  There are more important things at hand.~
@503  = ~Then their deaths ensure that such an event will not reoccur.~
@504  = ~According to your quaint customs, <CHARNAME>, their lives do not matter--they are Drow.  Why this sudden compassion for lives which are forfeit in your eyes anyway?~
@505  = ~Because they could be innocent, and even if they are Drow, they don't deserve to die for crimes they didn't commit.~
@506  = ~I would rather kill them in fair combat than watch them die for crimes they didn't commit.~
@507  = ~That's true.  But I still don't agree with killing innocent people.~
@508  = ~Yes--let's not waste any more time on these filth.  They may deserve a more...intricate death, but no matter.  There are more important things at hand.~
@509  = ~And I understand *you* far too well for my liking.~
@510  = ~Take it however you wish, fool.~
@511  = ~That is your perogative.  And it is mine to leave them to suffer a fate they most richly deserve.~
@512  = ~I have oft considered returning to the Underdark, under a different name, a different guise.  And now, presented with  the opportunity, I find myself unwilling.~ [I#BLANK]
@513  = ~Why so?~
@514  = ~Well, if you wanted to, this would be the perfect opportunity.~
@515  = ~Unwilling to rejoin the people you have so often praised?~
@516  = ~Viconia, not now.  We have a lot to do.~
@517  = ~I look upon these people, this place, and feel nothing but hatred and abhorrence.  I am no longer a slave to their cursed religion, to Lolth; I am no longer a thoughtless wretch living my life in cowed subservience.~
@518  = ~I am worth more than these slime could ever hope to be.~
@519  = ~That's not all, though, is it?~
@520  = ~If that's what you think, I'm not about to disillusion you.~
@521  = ~You are, I agree.  You've grown beyond their barbaric ways.~
@522  = ~As you wish, wael.  But do not expect any particular kindness on my part in future.~
@523  = ~No, it is not.  How very perceptive of you.~
@524  = ~I tire of your pathetic attempts to insult me, kivvil.  You do not know the first thing of a true insult; a true insult is when your people turn their back on you because you refuse to fit their mold.  Pfeh.~
@525  = ~Do you believe so?  If I were in a darker mood, perhaps I would show you the sheer stupidity of that statement.  But you are right, in a way.~
@526  = ~I have spent too much time on the surface.  I would no longer fit in here, and each hour we spend in Ust Natha only confirms this.  It is a disturbing thought.~
@527  = ~But I am glad to have left this stagnant society.  They are so caught up in their insignificant struggle for power within that they do not realise their true potential.~
@528  = ~If they simply stood together there would be few forces with the strength to contest their dominance.  They could rule Faerun, and yet they do not.~
@529  = ~Tell me, what do you think of this festering rot of a people, godspawn?  I assume you wish them dead; I believe that the popular opinion amongst surfacers is that the drow do not deserve their continued existance.  Are you in agreement with this view?~
@530  = ~Of course not.  They are an intriguing and powerful people, if divided.~
@531  = ~I did until I met you.  I was forced to examine my preconceptions at that point.~
@532  = ~I did before I came to the Underdark, and I continue to.  They are a disgusting, immoral and evil people.~
@533  = ~That division makes them weak.  It is a wonder they do not realise this.~
@534  = ~It hardly surprises me that I have had such an influence on you.  I am not what you would perhaps expect of the average mindless drow.~
@535  = ~A backhanded compliment--if they knew how you felt I am sure they would be gratified that their existance offends you so.~
@536  = ~I find it amusing that the very things they value are the things you surfacers abhor, and your virtues are the qualities they vilify.~
@537  = ~Not that I disagree with them, of course.  Your surfacer ideals are so pathetically flimsy that a mild breeze would knock them from the pedastal you place them upon.~
@538  = ~I realise now, however, the fallacies of the culture I was once so indelibly ingrained in.  Perhaps I have more to be grateful to them for than I give them credit.~
@539  = ~Regardless, I suggest you hurry in your efforts to escape.  Who knows how long it will be before your facade is given away--I do not predict more than a day, with your acting skills.  In future, allow me to speak with these people.  I am sure things will go far more smoothly.~
@540  = ~That pompous fool, how dare he presume to know my intentions?!  Elves--fools, all of them!~ [I#BLANK]
@541  = ~Calm yourself, Viconia!  How was he to know any better?~
@542  = ~Viconia, don't be foolish.  Not all elves are as aggravating as Elhan.~
@543  = ~I don't have time for this, Viconia.~
@544  = ~He seems sweet.~
@545  = ~Waela Eldalie kivvil, he will pay for this insult!  To think I would be a danger to them--I *will* be if I see his misbegotten, sniveling face once more!~
@546  = ~You, perhaps--but you are one of the few.  I would sooner associate with donkeys than with bigoted elves, if I had the choice.~
@547  = ~I would sooner associate with donkeys than with bigoted elves, if I had the choice.~
@548  = ~Then you will have your time, fool.  Waela Eldalie kivvil, he will pay for this insult...~
@549  = ~Sweet?  You must be sickly, then, <CHARNAME>.~
@550  = ~Let us away from this pathetic place, <CHARNAME>--and get this Lanthorn as speedily as we can, if only to remove ourselves from this bigot's presence.~
@551  = ~There is the strayed one!  Gather her, rothe...and kill the others!~
